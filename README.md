# OIT_Coding_Challenge
I am currently working as an FSY counselor and do not have access to many resources, so I hope using Google Workspace to complete this project is alright.
To play you select the start button (cells F2-I4) and an alert will pop up. 
Please be patient as sometimes Google's servers can be slow, but once you begin a game you can choose where to put an "X" by selecting the corresponding cell.
The computer is completely randomized. If I had more time I would have created a more advanced computer player. 

You can access the project as it was intended to be used at this link:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FPm0qjZK37WIve_BGYVlN_954ntOLwJF8-sC0wGCvrs/edit?usp=sharing

Or view the source code and screenshots as well as my limited documentation on this repo.
Please let me know if you have any difficulty accessing the project.

Thank you so much!
